Friday's colour documents the explorations of colour that we, Helen Cook and Elspeth Owen, have made together. We have been exchanging photographs every Friday for the duration of one season from December to March, from solstice to equinox, from Advent 2023 to Easter 2024.

Sometimes the images are taken close to home, sometimes they are the result of a search, or represent outings and events in our lives. Many are in response to a previous week. Always, they are chosen and considered. We send them without coordination on a hue or theme, and many weeks we find interesting similarities and contrasts between the images and their component colours that we exchange. Indeed, we are both responding to the season as it changes. 

We approach colour from very different viewpoints - Helen is a scientist turned painter whose mind is inclined toward analytical experimentation, and Elspeth is an artist and potter whose work experiments intuitively with colour. We are intrigued to work together in a way that both consciously and unconsciously plays with colour - and then inevitably with light. In these images we are not making colour, as we are doing in our work with other materials, but finding it - or giving it space to find us. Perhaps we want to publish these pictures just to say: these moments are everywhere, look around you and let your eyes forage for delights.
